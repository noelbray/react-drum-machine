# React Drum Machine
*__This is the code I wrote to complete the freeCodeCamp "Build A Drum Machine" challenge on Codepen.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:** 

- Red "Power Button": Click to turn the power on and off. When activated nothing will work.
- Click any of the buttons labeled with a letter of the alphabet or press the corresponding key that matches the alphabet character on button to hear a sound. 
- Click the "Switch Audio" button to switch the sounds from "Heater" to "Smooth Piano" or vice versa.
- The bar below the "Switch Audio" button is the "volume control bar." 
- Below the "volume control bar" let's you know the current "audio set" such as "Heater" or "Smooth Piano" you are on as well as the name of the audio button that was clicked and the current volume level when the volume is changed by the "volume control bar."


**Note:** 

If some of the audio buttons don't produce a sound, it may be that there is something wrong with website they come from. If this results in your playing displeasure, I'm sorry.  

**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
